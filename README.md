This repository started as a README file with a list of resources, as you can imagine with many contributions it made sense to create a website and have more structure. We are now working on a website to easily view and edit these resources ðŸ”— [freeweb3resources.com](https://www.freeweb3resources.com/)

### Contributing Resources
The easiest way to contribute is by going to our website [freeweb3resources.com](https://www.freeweb3resources.com/) and clicking `Get Started` on the homepage. This will take you to the `docs` section and from there you can navigate the sidebar to find the section for your resource, you should be able to see a list of resources and an edit button underneath. Click the edit button, which will take you to this GitHub repository, add your resource and commit message and then click 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request'.
