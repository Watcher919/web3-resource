Solana is a public blockchain platform with smart contract functionality. Its native cryptocurrency is SOL.
Solana achieves consensus using a proof-of-stake mechanism and its model, known as "proof-of-history" mechanism. Proof of history enables the network to operate faster because nodes do not need to communicate to validate a block. The Solana whitepaper describes this design as a decentralized clock.
