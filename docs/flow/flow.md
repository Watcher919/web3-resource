Flow is one of the leading blockchains for the next generation of apps, NFTs, and games. Itâ€™s designed to scale in a way that doesnâ€™t use sharding techniques, so transactions are fast and low-cost. Most notably, Flow is focused on reducing the complexity that is seen in other blockchains. Take, for example, purchasing a CryptoKitty. Behind the scenes, that process can involve dozens of blockchain transactions. But on Flow, the same action is handled by one atomic transaction in a single block.The Flow blockchain is designed not just to improve the end-user experience but also to allow developers to build, test, and launch projects quickly and sustainably.
