# Axelar

Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3, enabling you to build Interchain dApps that grow beyond a single chain. 

**Secure** means Axelar is built on proof-of-stake, the battle-tested approach used by Ethereum, Polygon, Cosmos, and more. 

**Cross-chain** communication means you can build a complete experience for your users that lets them interact with any asset, any application, on any chain with one click.
