Tezos set out in 2014 to create what it called a “self-amending blockchain”. Complex in implementation, at its core, the concept was simple: Tezos would allow anyone who owned its XTZ cryptocurrency to vote on possible changes to its rules, and once decided, the software would automatically update to ensure the changes were made. 
By using this system, Tezos aimed to reduce the chances its blockchain might fork, creating two separate cryptocurrencies with two distinct prices.
